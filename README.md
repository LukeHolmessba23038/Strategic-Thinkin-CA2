# Ethereum Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict Ethereum prices using historical data from 2015 to 2023. By applying various machine learning techniques, the project explores the capabilities of different models to understand and predict Ethereum price movements. The primary goal is to provide insights that could aid investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning model implementation
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding sessions

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Python 3.8 or above is recommended. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/ethereum-price-prediction.git
cd ethereum-price-prediction


pip install -r requirements.txt


Files Description
Ethereum Merged Data.csv: The dataset containing historical data of Ethereum prices.
ethereum_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all the analyses, model training, and validation steps.
requirements.txt: A file listing all the dependencies needed to run the notebook.
How to Run
To view and run the notebook, you need to start Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
This will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open a tab in your default web browser. From there, navigate to ethereum_price_prediction.ipynb to open and run the notebook.
